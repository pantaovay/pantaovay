<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Peter</h1>

As the Co-Founder and CTO of [Particle Network](https://particle.network), I bring deep technical knowledge and insights into blockchain technology, consistently contributing to and focusing on technological and product innovations in the Web3 space. Starting with Wallet-as-a-Service, we keenly identified the barriers for users entering Web3 and were the first in the industry to launch an MPC-TSS solution, attracting a large number of developers and users. Our chain abstraction product, powered by L1-driven Universal Accounts, addresses the fragmentation of users and liquidity issues in Web3.

During my tenure at MiniJoy, I built a social gaming application from scratch, serving hundreds of millions of users globally. At Tongzhuo Games, we pioneered a new gameplay scenario combining mini-games with social features, **securing over $20 million** in funding from renowned VCs such as **Alibaba, SoftBank Ventures, and Qiming Venture Partners**. As a core member and CTO of the project, I supported the technical architecture from zero to scale, accommodating **over 5 million** daily active users and **over 100 million** users.

With **extensive experience and knowledge in blockchain**, systems architecture, and software development, I have managed teams of over 100 people, offering profound insights and hands-on expertise in technical management. Additionally, I am highly skilled in **product innovation and management**, having developed multiple products from scratch that have gone on to serve hundreds of millions of users worldwide, spanning diverse fields such as gaming and social networking.
